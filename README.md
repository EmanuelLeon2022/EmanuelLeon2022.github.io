# Emanuel Leon-Vargas

This is a webpage of my design, which includes a list of some of the projects which I have done, an API of my choice, and a resume page that shows visitors some small stuff about me.

It also has some bugs, which I am currently tweaking.
It has been posted to render, but it has a few bugs on site.

## Technologies

### HTML
### CSS
### JavaScript
### React JS
### GitHub

#### Browser router works by allowing to create paths on my website that change the URL, within the pages reach. The link property allows me to open website URLs, if I link '/element' it will append it to the current website's URL.

## Overall

#### Website links will glitch out when hovered on, it is a feature on the site.

## Snail Race
#### Takes you to a live site version of my Snail race

## API
### <a href='https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/' target='_blank'>Zelda Comendium</a>

## Cool Stuff

#### On this page you will find my resume with Link and Sonic trying to push the element's but end up unsuccessful.

#### To use this page you have to use the "→", "↑", "W", and "D" key to interact with Sonic and Link.

#### "→" will make Sonic try to push the Professional Summary, and "↑" will make Sonic breakdance.
#### "D" will make Link try to push the professional Experience, and "W" will make Link hold the Tri-Force.

## About Me

#### On this page you will find a not as cool version of my resume.
