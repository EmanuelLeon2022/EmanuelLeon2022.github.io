#Emanuel Leon-Vargas

This is a webpage of my design, which includes a list of some of the projects which I have done, an API of my choice, and a resume page that shows visitors some small stuff about me.

It also has some bugs, which I am currently tweaking.
It has been posted to render, but it has a few bugs on site.

Browser router works by allowing to create paths on my website that change the URL, within the pages reach. The link property allows me to open website URLs, if I link '/element' it will append it to the current website's URL.
