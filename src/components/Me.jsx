            <p>* Leones Construction - Construction Worker  - Pittsburgh, PA 06/2023 - 08/2023</p>
            <p> Drywall Installation - requires measurement of the workspace, framing 2x4 beams, and drilling the drywall onto the frame to keep it locked in place. Once that is complete, the wall needs to be taped (a process in which you use joint compound to seal crevices in the wall), then painted with a coat of primer.</p>
            <p> Decking Installation - requires measurement of where the platform will be placed, placing multiple 2x8 boards in a row form and jointing them with solid brackets and decking screws, and lastly pacing out the decking floor boards in a way where they are properly spaced between to walk on.</p>
